#  Assignment 3
# Module 4: Functions & Modules in Python
# Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

In this task, we create a function to calculate the factorial of a number.

Steps:

 # Define a function using def.

Use an if-else condition:

If x == 1, return 1.

Else, return x * factorial(x - 1) (call the function recursively).

Take user input and store it in a variable num.

Print the factorial of the number.

# Example:

Enter a Number: 5  
The factorial of 5 is: 120

# Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

In this task, we use the math module to perform different calculations.

# 1. Square Root

Import the math module.

Take input from the user and store it in a.

Use math.sqrt(a) to calculate the square root.

Print the result.

# 2. Natural Logarithm

Check if the number is positive.

If a > 0, use math.log(a) to calculate the natural logarithm and print it.

Else, print that the number is negative and cannot have a logarithm.

# 3. Sine of the Number (in Radians)

Use math.sin(a) to find the sine value.

Print the result.

# Example 
Enter a number :25
Square root:  5.0
Logarithm of  25 is :  3.2188758248682006
Sine 25  is : -0.13235175009777303
